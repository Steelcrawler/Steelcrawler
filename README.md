**Software Engineering Intern** - Mezzi - Building multi-LLM financial advice systems with Go backend  

## Tech Stack

**Languages:** Python, Golang, C/C++, Java, JavaScript, MIPS Assembly, R  
**ML/AI:** PyTorch, OpenCV, NumPy, 3DCNNs, RAG systems  
**Backend:** Flask, Django, REST APIs, Firestore, Redis  
**Frontend:** React, NextJS, Tailwind CSS  
**Cloud/DevOps:** GCP, Azure, AWS, Kubernetes, Docker

## Notable Projects

**mAIstro!** (GenAI Genesis) - Cross-document analysis platform with adaptive mastery system  
**The Other Side** (UofT Hacks 12) - Real-time fact-checked debate platform using Vertex AI  
**DeepEmotion** (UTMIST) - fMRI emotion classification with 3DCNNs, submitted to CUCAI
